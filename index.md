<b style="text-align: center;">Conference Theme: Ethics, Equity, and Sustainability in Software Business </b>

The International Conference on Software Business (ICSOB) 2024 aims to redefine the software industry’s future through a scientific lens, focusing on ethics, equity, and sustainability. As digital transformation becomes ubiquitous, integrating these principles into software development and business strategies is crucial for fostering social justice, human rights, and democracy. ICSOB 2024 invites interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to address ethical challenges, promote inclusivity, and ensure sustainable practices in the software sector. Key areas of exploration include ethical considerations in software product management, the role of emerging technologies like Blockchain and Generative AI in shaping ethical frameworks, and the implementation of sustainability metrics within software ecosystems. The conference will emphasize the development of transparent, trustworthy software business models that champion diversity and equity. Through scientific inquiry, case studies, and workshops, ICSOB 2024 seeks to catalyze innovation at the nexus of ethics, equity, and sustainability, contributing to a software business paradigm that prioritizes long-term ecological and social well-being. This gathering will serve as a platform for generating actionable insights and fostering a software industry that is not only technologically advanced but also ethically responsible and inclusive.

The Conference holds societal impact and international importance as it tackles the pivotal challenges of managing and innovating within software-intensive businesses in our rapidly evolving digital landscape. In an era marked by relentless technological advancements and an insatiable demand for innovation, ICSOB 2024 stands as a critical platform for addressing the implications of digital transformation on society. By fostering a dialogue on ethical, equitable, and sustainable practices in the software business, the conference directly contributes to shaping a future where technology not only advances economic growth but also promotes social justice, human rights, and environmental stewardship. The conference’s emphasis on inclusivity, diversity, and equity in software ecosystems resonates with global efforts to bridge digital divides and ensure that the benefits of digital transformation are accessible to all, thereby reinforcing its international significance. ICSOB 2024’s call for both research and industry papers underscores its commitment to bridging the gap between academic inquiry and practical application, ensuring that the insights generated have real-world relevance and impact. By highlighting industry case studies and pioneering research in software-intensive business, the conference acts as a beacon for international collaboration, knowledge exchange, and innovation, setting a precedent for responsible and inclusive growth in the digital age.
